# Change-of-design-via-text-box.
I am trying to change the design by using a text field as input-name in HTML (part of code it is uncommented in JS)
It works by using PROMPT IF ELSE stuff...
But am trying to make it work by typing text into html input with box that I made by myself (I commented it out in script.js).
